Data Set Information:

Format: Each observation concerns one university. In some cases, more information is provided about the attribute (e.g., units or domain). Some duplicates may exist and a single observation may have more than one value for a given attribute (esp. academic emphasis). 

It appears that several attributes could serve as a distinguished class attribute for this database. The data file remains in the state as given to us by Steve Souders. It is a LISP readable file with a few relevant functions at the end of the data file. The info on missing data values have not been calculated. We hope to get to this in the future.


Attribute Information:

1. University-name 
2. State 
3. location 
4. Control 
5. number-of-students 
6. male:female (ratio) 
7. student:faculty (ratio) 
8. sat-verbal 
9. sat-math 
10. expenses 
11. percent-financial-aid 
12. number-of-applicants 
13. percent-admittance 
14. percent-enrolled 
15. academics 
16. social 
17. quality-of-life 
18. academic-emphasis
